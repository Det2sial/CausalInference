ABORTION AND CRIME RATES IN NYC

TODO
====

  1. Write abstract and introduction
  2. Start analysis
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tehcniques we can use
=====================

  1. Reduced form equation
  2. Counterfactual analysis by comparing data with cities where legalized abortion was not present before 1973 (Roe vs Wade)
  3. Instrumental Variables analysis for isolating the effect of the surge in crime rates due to crack-cocaine abuse
  4. Stratified Propensity score analysis for comparing 2 different cities (think of Chicago, Sydney etc.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things we have to consider
==========================

  * Confounding effect of crime rise due to crack-cocaine abuse during the 1980s and ending in the early 1990s
  * Abortion data may be by state of residence or by state of occurence (medical tourism)
  * Does the rise of abortion rates truly mean that there were less unwanted children? NO! Other inventions like birth contraception and non-stationarity of data (number  of births per capita also fell between 1970-1975)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working strategies
==================
  * Read the paper "abortion and crime" (Joyce et al.)
  * Start learning the techniques mentioned above mainly
	*  Reduced form analysis
	*  Instrumental variables analysis
  * Grab datasets mentioned in the paper above
