ABOUT  
Final project for course CS-582, Causal Inference. What lead to a decrease in crime in NYC since the 1960s? After reading from Steven Levitt's book Freakonomics, we assumed that features listed below may contribute to the decrease and our aim is to examine the causal relation of these features to the crime rate in NYC.  
**YUAN**  
- Abortion rates / legalization (ultimately identified as the root cause in the book)  
- Increased incarceration rates -> change to prisoner population  

**AUBHIK**
